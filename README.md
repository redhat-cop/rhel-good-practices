# Welcome to RHEL Good Practices
Welcome to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux Good Practices page. Here we aim to collect technical and non-technical good practices for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

We encourage everyone to contribute their best practices. [Checkout the contribution guide for more information](https://redhat-cop.github.io/rhel-good-practices/contribute/contributing/)

## What is this page NOT about
This page gathers various good practices, but it does not:

* Replace Red Hat's official documentation.
* Replace Red Hat support
* Provide a definite answer for something. We deal with good practices, meaning there may be multiple ways to do something.
