It's good if you create some type of standard naming here, such as: rhel-(system-name)-(team name)-admin, rhel-(system-name)-(team name)-user, etc. The team in question can then own these groups and do user management themselves.</li> <li>Users added to group - Users are added to the groups in question. This may be done by the team who are being onboarded.</li> <li>RBAC configuration created on servers - You now put in place the required RBAC related configuration on your server, as it relates to things such as sudoers, ssh, pam, sssd, etc. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"operational-model/mvp/#development-processes","title":"Development processes","text":"<ul> <li>There are no standardized processes yet, related to how we are developing our RHEL platform.

How do you know if utilization of CPU, memory or storage goes through the roof? How do you know that your backup client or security related services are running? Monitoring.</li> <li>Repository management - If your systems can connect to Red Hat's YUM repositories, then this item is resolved. Please note that when you do update your systems, they will be updated to whatever latest versions are available. If you want control over what version of software gets installed on your RHEL servers, or if your systems cannot be connected to Red Hat provided YUM repositories, then you need to decide how you will manage the RHEL yum repositories yourself. Via some 3rd party system or by simply synchronizing related repositories to some local NFS or HTTP server?</li> <li>Subscription management - If your systems can conntact to Red Hat's services, then you will be able to manage your subscriptions via Red Hat's online Subscription Management page.

Red Hat has some standard RHEL package definitions such as core, base, which can inspire you. Also, if you have a look at a standard RHEL KVM or Cloud images, that can also be used for inspiration.</li> <li>User and identity management - How will you do users management in your RHEL standard? Will you allow the use of local users? Will you require the use of some LDAP service for identity and authentication? Will you mandate the use of service accounts for automation? You better decide these things now, before you have hundreds of servers.</li> <li>RBAC - This relates to configuring who gets access to do what. Will everyone have root access? Or will only some people have this? This is where you decide on any separation of duty enforcements and configure related services such as sssd, sshd, sudoers, pam, etc.</li> <li>Installation - Decide on how to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Starting off with your RHEL Linux standard platform, it is not unusual that people manually installs RHEL. With that said, nowdays it's also common that you start off with some automated installation, using standard RHEL images you download and built in virtualization or cloud features such as cloud init.</li> <li>Manual patch management - In the beginning of your RHEL journey, it's not uncommon that patch management is a manual process. You still need to decide on how to do patching though. This includes the process of making patches available to your systems, ensuring backups are in place, installing updates, testing so that nothing broke, etc. If this process is not automated it soon becomes very painful to scale the numbers of your installed based of RHEL.

Please note that the graphics describes all three advancement levels of onboarding.</p> <p></p> <p>The steps for the 2.0 version of the onboarding process follows: * Automated onboarding - Configuration required to provide access to a new team is performed automatically. This includes creation of LDAP groups, adding users and configuring systems to provide access to the newly onboarded team. * Initial assessment of workload - As new team are onboarded you need to do assessments of the team and their workloads to be able to provide a good service and speed up adoption. * Requirements assessment - Ask the team some simple questions related to what they will actually run on their Linux instances. Depending on what they answer, it may be good to add new features to your platform, to support their workload. As an example, if the team requires PCI DSS compliance, you may add PCI DSS hardening in your Red Hat Enterprise Linux standard, and get Red Hat Satellite to get simplified compliance reporting. * Training assessment - Just providing someone a tool, without any instructions about how to use it will hurt standardization and securiry and can create all sorts of long term challenges. Assess what type of training the new team needs. * DevOps training required - It is common that newly onboarded teams needs training related to modern practices to manage Linux, this may include things such as: version control, testing, CI/CD and such. This will be key for them to understand. If you fail to catch this type of training requirement that will negatively impact overall standardization for your installed base. * Linux training required - Does the team getting onboarded need training related to how Red Hat Enterprise Linux works? It's good if you have some hands-on training regarding that, as an operating system is a complicated thing which no person can be expected to understand without training. * Training - This is the delivery of the training. If you cannot deliver this yourself, many companies, including Red Hat - has training available.</p>"},{"location":"operational-model/twozero/#development-processes","title":"Development processes","text":"<p>Processes related to the development of your RHEL platform.</p> <ul> <li>Documentation - You have requirements related to what you should document regarding your platform features.</li> <li>External contributions - How do people outside of the RHEL platform team contribute features to the standard?

Initially this may be a semi-manual process, where you do an installation and see if it was successful. As you move forward, this will have to be automated.</li> <li>CI/CD - In order to automate your development processes, you need CI/CD. But how do you work with CI/CD? That is what this process describes.</li> <li>RHEL best practices - It's common that you have a standard for how to write a programming language, based on best practices.

It provides you with a host of information. About the patch state of systems, known vulnerabilities. Also, are you tired of working reactively? It can also provide you advise on how to work proactively to ensure that issues which may become problems - does not.</li> <li>Image build system - If you install RHEL by creating a system from an image, such as virtual machine template or etc, then you will need a system dedicated to building such images. Also, if you are to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux Image Mode (RHEL 9.6+, 10+), you will need a system to build those images. Learn more about that here. </li> <li>Red Hat Satellite - It's not uncommon that this is something you get immediately for your first release, and there are some good reasons for that.

If you do not do this, you will not be able to scale your install base without some very significant issues.
